# Feed Reader Test (Udacity Front-end Nanodegree)

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It is our job to write test suites to test the pre-determined problems that might occur. These test are written using the Jasmine testing framework. 


## How to run the app

Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice. The upper part of the screen will show you the Feed Reader and the bottom half will show you the Jasmine tests.
    * Bullet list
    * The Tests show the result of the Jasmine testing that was done on the application
    * If the tests are all run successfully(all dots are green), the appliction should be running as required.
    * We are testing for the following things:
        1. All the feeds have a name and a URL connected to it.
        2. On Default the menu is hidden and toggles visibility when it is clicked on. 
        3. There is at least one feed loaded to the page.
        4. When changing feeds, the page content changes according to the selected feed.
